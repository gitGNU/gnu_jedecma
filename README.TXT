About Jedecma

In the early ninety years I developed, for a friend of mine - a well known surgeon, a software for breast ultrasound examinations archiving for DOS-compatible computers, named 'ED.EC.MA' as an acrostic from user initials and the italian expression "ECografie MAmmarie" (=breast ultrasound examinations).

In the middle 'of the 2000s I started developing a Java project, hence the name 'Jedecma', aimed to a better integration with graphic environment and printing capabilities provided by available operating systems, as requested by the user.

I developed this project entirely in GNU/Linux environment, which is what I choose for my own use.
Notice also that this project is my first project in Java, and therefore you must consider it as the work of a beginner.

First releases of Jedecma have started working from 2007. This program has been used with computers equipped with non-free operating systems, only in stand-alone mode.

In 2011 the user of Jedecma ceased his activity, and so Jedecma.
Later, the user of Jedecma, involved as lecturer in a conference cycle, has planned to cite as example this program and allow participants to obtain a copy free of charge, so we decided to release it as Free Software.

To ease installation, configuration and back-up tasks I provided an embedded database as default database engine, so the program can be installed simply copying and pasting it to the destination directory and it should run out-the-box in single user mode.
A ready-to-use binary version can be found at: 
http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/jedecma/

Please be aware that the current version reflects the changes done in order to release it as Free Software and in this form it has never really been used.

Hoping this can help.
Best Regards

The splash image, a rudimentary photo-montage made by me, displays the user of Jedecma at work.
